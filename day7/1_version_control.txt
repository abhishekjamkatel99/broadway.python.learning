On developing apps or products, we may have different versions of the product.
If the new version is updated then, the previous version code should also be maintained.
So, such maintaining of version is carried by version control system. There are different version control
systems like git, mercurial, perforce etc.

 Need of version control system.
 a. To maintain product versions.
 b. For team collaboration in a project



The codes of project should be stored in the cloud. Google drive or any other cloud storage services can be used
for storing code, but they doesn't provide git support and there will be more manual work for team collaboration
So, we use cloud services which understand git instead of google service.
The example of such cloud services which understand git are, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc.
