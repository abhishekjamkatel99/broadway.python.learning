# Python lists are mutable objects
# We can create a list by enclosing a sequence in big brackets []

# We can also create a list using list() built-in function

a= [] #An empty list
b=list() # An empty list using list() function

a=[1,2,3] #Non- empty list
# In this list, all data are of interger data-type. but list can also have g=hextrogenous type

a= [1, "Hello", 2.1, {1,2,3},{"a":1,"b":2}]
# In this list, the data are of diffrent types which is also supported by a python list


# We can use built-type() function to check the type of an object
type([1,2,3]) #List
type((1,2,3)) #tuble
type (1) #int
# and so on...
